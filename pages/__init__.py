pages/__init__.py

This file makes the 'pages' directory a Python package.
In a Streamlit multi-page app, files in this directory (excluding those starting with '_')
are automatically detected and added as navigable pages in the sidebar.

The naming convention of files (e.g., '1_Page_Name.py', '2_Another_Page.py')
determines their order in the Streamlit sidebar navigation.
