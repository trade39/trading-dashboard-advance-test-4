    st.subheader("1.1. Uploading Your Trading Journal")
    st.markdown(f"""
    To begin, you need to upload your trading journal as a CSV file using the file uploader in the sidebar.

    **Expected CSV Format:**
    The dashboard expects your CSV file to have specific column headers. While the application attempts to clean
    common variations (e.g., converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores), adhering to a consistent
    format will ensure the best results.

    The core columns the application looks for (as configured in `config.py` under `EXPECTED_COLUMNS`) are:
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('date', 'date')}`**: The timestamp of the trade (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"). This is crucial for time-based analysis.
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('pnl', 'pnl')}`**: The Profit or Loss for each trade (numeric value). This is the primary metric for performance.
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('symbol', 'symbol_1')}`**: The trading instrument/symbol (e.g., "EURUSD", "XAUUSD", "AAPL").
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('strategy', 'trade_model')}`**: The name or identifier of the trading strategy used.
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('notes', 'lesson_learned')}`**: Any qualitative notes or lessons learned from the trade.
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('duration_minutes', 'duration_mins')}`**: Duration of the trade in minutes (numeric).
    * **`{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('risk', 'risk')}`**: The amount risked on the trade (numeric, used for R:R calculations). If not provided, some risk-related metrics might be unavailable or calculated differently.
    * Other columns like `{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('entry_price', 'entry')}`, `{EXPECTED_COLUMNS.get('exit_price', 'exit')}` can also be utilized.

    *Please ensure your column names in the CSV file correspond to these expected names after basic cleaning (lowercase, underscores for spaces).*
    For example, a CSV column "Trade Model " will be cleaned to "trade_model" by the application.
    Check `config.py` for the exact `EXPECTED_COLUMNS` mapping if you encounter issues.

    Once data is uploaded, you can use the filters in the sidebar to refine the dataset for analysis:

    * **Date Range:** Select a specific period for analysis.
    * **Symbol:** Filter trades by a specific trading symbol.
