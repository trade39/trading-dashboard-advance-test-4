utils/__init__.py

This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package, allowing
modules within it to be imported using dot notation (e.g., from utils.logger import setup_logger).
"""
# You can optionally import modules here to make them available at the package level,
# for example:
# from .logger import setup_logger
# from .common_utils import load_css

# For now, keeping it empty is standard practice if direct imports from submodules are preferred.
